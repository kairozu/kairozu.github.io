ハルロック (Haru Rock) is a manga series that follows the evolution of a college girl’s obsession with computers and electronics. The technical details of Haru’s projects are featured as they relate to the story. It’s published in Japanese, but I’ve been slowly translating it — half as a fan effort, half because it’s good Japanese practice.

Translating meaning from implication is difficult when you don’t have a fluent grasp of a language.. doubly so when you’re trying to make interactions sound reasonable and not forced. Throw in the fact that I have limited graphical space with which to insert words, and each page becomes a time consuming challenge. The process is enormously beneficial to me from a language perspective, as I have a vested interest in quality vs immediate understanding.

Some things just don’t translate well, owing to their cultural significance. I was explaining to a Japanese friend of mine that while 会社員 translates literally as “company employee” or “office worker” — that’s not generally how someone would reply to the question “what do you do for a living?” in English. While initially giving one’s job title in Japanese might be considered mildly egocentric, saying you are an office worker feels bizarrely vague in English — translating a dialogue involves making adjustments for those differences. I have an entirely new respect for the folks who’ve been releasing fansubs for unlicensed anime series as a labor of love.

I wouldn’t call my first two pages a success; the dialogue flow is stunted at best, but I think I faithfully conveyed the original material’s intent, even if it reads awkwardly in English. These are the Japanese/English pages I’ve done so far:
